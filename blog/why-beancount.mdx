# Why We Chose Beancount

When building FIREla, we evaluated dozens of accounting formats. We chose [Beancount](http://furius.ca/beancount/). Here's why.

## The Problem with Traditional Finance Apps

Most personal finance tools store your data in proprietary databases:

- **Opaque** - You can't see how your data is structured
- **Locked** - Export formats are limited or non-existent
- **Fragile** - One company decision can orphan years of data

## Enter Plain Text Accounting

Plain text accounting stores your financial records in simple text files:

```beancount
2024-01-15 * "Coffee Shop"
  Expenses:Dining:Coffee    5.50 USD
  Assets:Bank:Checking     -5.50 USD
```

Benefits:

- **Human-readable** - Anyone can understand it
- **Version-controllable** - Track every change with Git
- **Portable** - Works with any text editor
- **Future-proof** - Text files will always be readable

## Why Beancount Specifically

We evaluated Ledger, HLedger, and Beancount. Beancount won because:

| Feature | Beancount | Ledger | HLedger |
|---------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Syntax clarity | ✅ Clean | Verbose | Clean |
| Python ecosystem | ✅ Native | Plugin | Plugin |
| Error messages | ✅ Helpful | Cryptic | Good |
| Community | Growing | Large | Medium |
| Validation | ✅ Strict | Loose | Medium |

## How FIREla Uses Beancount

FIREla doesn't replace Beancount—it enhances it:

1. **Visual editing** - GUI for transaction entry
2. **Automated imports** - Bank sync, CSV parsing
3. **Smart categorization** - AI-assisted transaction labeling
4. **Beautiful reports** - Interactive charts and dashboards

Your underlying `.beancount` files remain pure text, fully under your control.

<Note>
You can always edit your Beancount files directly in any text editor. FIREla is a layer on top, not a lock-in.
