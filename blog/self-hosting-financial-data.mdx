# The Case for Self-Hosting Financial Data

Every time you connect a bank account to a financial app, you're making a trade: convenience for control.

We think that's a bad deal.

## The Data Economy

Financial apps are often free for a reason: your data is the product.

<Warning>
Your financial data reveals your income, spending habits, relationships, health conditions, political donations, and more.
</Warning>

This data is valuable. Companies use it to:

- Build credit profiles
- Target advertisements
- Train machine learning models
- Sell to data brokers

## The Self-Hosting Alternative

Self-hosting means running software on infrastructure you control:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Your Server               │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │      FIREla Instance        │   │
│  │  ┌─────────────────────┐    │   │
│  │  │   Your Financial    │    │   │
│  │  │       Data          │    │   │
│  │  └─────────────────────┘    │   │
│  └─────────────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
         You control this
```

Benefits:

- **Privacy** - No third-party access
- **Ownership** - Your data, your rules
- **Permanence** - No company can deprecate your data
- **Customization** - Modify the software to fit your needs

## Common Concerns

### "Isn't self-hosting complicated?"

It used to be. FIREla runs in Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

That's it. No DevOps degree required.

### "What about security?"

Paradoxically, self-hosting can be *more* secure:

- **Attack surface** - Your server isn't a high-value target like a SaaS with millions of users
- **Transparency** - You can audit every line of code
- **Control** - You decide who has access

### "What if I'm not technical?"

We're building managed hosting options. But the self-hosted option will always exist for those who want it.

## The Bigger Picture

We believe in a future where:

- Individuals own their data
- Software is transparent and auditable
- Vendor lock-in is a choice, not a trap

FIREla is a small step toward that future.
