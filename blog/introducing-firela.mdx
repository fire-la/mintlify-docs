# Introducing FIREla

Most financial apps have a dirty secret: they own your data.

You upload your transactions, categorize your spending, build years of financial history—and then you're locked in. Can't export. Can't inspect. Can't leave.

**FIREla is different.**

## Why We Built This

We believe your financial data is among your most personal information. It reveals:

- Where you shop and what you buy
- How much you earn and save
- Your habits, goals, and anxieties

This data shouldn't be held hostage by a closed platform you can't export from, inspect, or fork away from.

## The FIREla Approach

  <Card title="Open Source" icon="code-branch">
    Full transparency. Audit the code yourself.

  <Card title="Self-Hosted" icon="server">
    Your data lives on your servers, not ours.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Beancount" icon="file-code">
    Plain text accounting. Human-readable, version-controllable.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What's Next

We're building FIREla in the open. Here's what's on our roadmap:

- **Core ledger management** - Beancount file editing and validation
- **Transaction import** - Bank sync and CSV import
- **Reporting** - Net worth tracking, spending analysis
- **Mobile app** - iOS and Android clients
