# Beancount Basics

FIREla is built on [Beancount](http://furius.ca/beancount/), a plain text double-entry accounting system.

## What is Beancount?

Beancount is a text-based accounting format that:

- Uses plain text files you can edit with any text editor
- Supports double-entry bookkeeping
- Is version-control friendly (Git)
- Is human-readable and auditable

## Basic Syntax

### Account Declaration

```beancount

1990-01-01 open Liabilities:CreditCard USD
1990-01-01 open Expenses:Food USD
1990-01-01 open Income:Salary USD
```
