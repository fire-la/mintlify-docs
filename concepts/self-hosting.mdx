# Self-Hosting

One of FIREla's core principles is self-hosting. Your financial data stays on your servers.

## Why Self-Host?

- **Data sovereignty** - Your data never leaves your infrastructure
- **Privacy** - No third-party access to your financial information
- **Control** - Full control over updates, backups, and configuration
- **Cost** - No subscription fees, only your infrastructure costs

## Deployment Options

### Docker Compose

The simplest self-hosting option:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Kubernetes

For production deployments, use our Helm chart:

```bash
helm repo add firela https://fire-la.github.io/charts
helm install firela firela/firela
```

### Manual Deployment

See our [installation guide](/installation) for manual setup.

## Data Backup

Your data is stored in:

- **PostgreSQL** - Transaction data and metadata
- **Beancount files** - Plain text ledger files

### Backup Strategy

```bash
# Backup PostgreSQL
pg_dump firela > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Backup Beancount files
cp -r /data/beancount /backup/beancount_$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

<Warning>
Always encrypt your backups. Financial data is sensitive!
</Warning>

## Security Considerations

- Use HTTPS with valid certificates
- Enable authentication
- Regularly update dependencies
- Restrict network access
- Enable audit logging
